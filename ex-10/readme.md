# Wrapping up

## Is this it?

Nope - This workshop has more or less provided a `happy-path` intro. You should expect a few hurdles in your journey, things like

- False positives is a sizable challenge
    - Scanners needs to be fine tuned to your context (detectors, testing, verification +++)
- Incremental scans would be helpful
    - Depending on you context you don't want to scan everything all the time
- Don't underestimate the cultural change. Document how your team does Secure Development, use in on-boarding, use in retrospectives - especially when you identity *interesting* pattern's.

There are several tools out there. Currently we focus on the open source versions. 

## We are done

Now you

- have a few more tools in your toolbox
- have a good idea about risks and good practices
- have to bring the new knowledge back to your team
- should consider Threat modelling your SDLC with your team
