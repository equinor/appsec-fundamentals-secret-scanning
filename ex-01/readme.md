# What's the problem?

The problem is that secrets like API keys, private keys, client secretsâ€”or any secret that ends up in our code can and will be used by adversaries to do harm.

## Some statistics from 2023

Stats from ([GitGuardian, Report on Secrets Sprawl 2024](https://www.gitguardian.com/state-of-secrets-sprawl-report-2024))

- 12.8 million new secrets detected in public GitHub commits in 2023 (+28%)
- More than 90% of secrets remained valid 5 days after being leaked
- 3 million GitHub repositories leaked a secret
- More than 1 in 10 authors on GitHub exposed a secret in 2023
- Leaking secrets is often done as a mistake or out of convenience, by seniors and juniors! (2022)
- OpenAI keys leakage increased 1212x (46k keys each month)
- The use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most common cause for data breaches (2022)

## Some recent examples

- Rabbit Inc., 2024, hard-coded secrets allowing unauthorized access to personal data and control over R1 devices ([link](https://www.doppler.com/blog/updated-data-breaches-caused-by-leaks-in-2024))
- Mercedes-Benz, 2024, mistakenly published GitHub token exposed Mercedes-Benz source code ([link](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/mercedez-benz-token-exposed-source-code-github/))
- Meta AI, late 2023, AI models cracked open with exposed API tokens (GitHub, Hugging Face) ([link](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/meta-ai-models-cracked-open-exposed-api-tokens))
- Verizon 2023 DBIR (Data Breaches Investigation Report), 16.3k incidents examined, 74% involves human element, 86% of basic web attacks involves stolen credentials ([link](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/))
- September 2023, [Microsoft Signing Key](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/results-of-major-technical-investigations-for-storm-0558-key-acquisition/)
- August 2023, [Grafana Private Signing key](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/08/24/grafana-security-update-gpg-signing-key-rotation/)

And we do security research at Equinor as well:

- Some recent stats will be shared.

## Adversaries are monitoring all public commits

- All public commits on GitHub are constantly monitored by adversaries (and certain commercial companies)
- It takes seconds from the secret being exposed to someone trying to exploit it

(The use of honey tokens gives us some insight (`demo`))

## Key advice - keep secrets out of source code

- Keep all secrets out of source code and containers. This goes for public, internal, and private repos!
- Deploy secret/credential scanning into your SDLC
